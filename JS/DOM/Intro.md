# What is DOM?

> With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The Document Object Model is constructed as a tree of oject. Javascript could interact with HTML!

### append vs appendchild

> append allows node and string but appendchild only allows node

### innerText vs innerHTML vs textContent

1. innerText only return text
2. innerHTML return text, space and innter element tags
3. textContent return return text with space

### window onload vs document onload

> The general idea is that window.onload fires when the document's window is ready for presentation and document.onload fires when the DOM tree (built from the markup code within the document) is completed.

### Navigating between nodes

1. parentNode
2. childNodes[nodenumber]
3. firstChild
4. lastChild
5. nextSibling
6. previousSibling
