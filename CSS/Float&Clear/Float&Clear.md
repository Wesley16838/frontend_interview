# Float and Clear

## Float

> The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.

```javascript
//The element floats to the left of its container
float: left;

//	The element floats the right of its container
float: right;

float: none;
float: inherit;
```

## Clear

> Clear property could specify elements can float on which side

1. Clear: none
   > Allows floating elements on both sides and it's default.
2. Clear: left/right
   > No floating elements allowed on left/right side.
3. Clear: both
   > No floating elements allowed on both the left & right sides
