### Under Pressure?

> Pressure plays an important role for me to make a good outcome because it helps me stay focused and motivated. Of course, there are sometimes when too much pressure can lead to stress. However, I'm very skilled at balancing multiple tasks it prevents me from feeling overly stressed.
> For example, I once had lots of issues need to fixed and also create a new feature due in the same week, and that was a lot of pressure. However, because I prioritize the issue based on whether it causes the app to crash or not and created a schedule to track the project progress, I managed to complete the new features and main issues ahead of time and avoided unnecessary stress.

### Mistake and How to handle?

> Time at Advantech, show our product to real-world customer in an internationcal exhibition. One of panels I created did not work

1. Admit my fault at first
2. Did my best to identify the cause of the issue
3. Provide feasible solution
4. No time modify code so make a video and paste it as an image
5. minimize the cost of mistake and earn trust back from manager or customer

### Conflict?

> During my time at ASUS, there was a backend developer who likes to avoid taking responsibility. It was quite hard to communicate with him because he always thought I could fix issues by myself AND I could not express my idea clearly because I was not familiar with architecture when I just joined the company for 2 months. Therefore, I took lots of time researching the architecht and dataflow so that I could clearly express my idea to him and convince him to do his task. For example, he asked me to save gaming mode in the local file and send extra request to set gaming mode during the first time loading. However, it will make app slower becasue it is unnecessary request if he saved gaming mode in the device. Since I collected information to support my idea in advance, I successfully convince him to do his task.

### Disagree?

> During my time at Brilltek, there was one time that manager asked us to add the anime when user slide the card. However, it is not in the original plan and the schedule was intensive. I explain why we couldn't finish this feature in this sprint and request to move this new feature to the next sprint. First, this anime has lower priority and not necessary. Secondly, I like to provide a great customer experience, so I did not want to present a product that hasn't finished to the customer.
> As a result, we successfully presented the demo to the customer in the next sprint meeting and get the positive feedback from them.

### How Achieve Goal?

> When I start work at ASUS, I was assigned to develop the main device which is gaming keyboard in our product. It was a motivational challenge because not all employee could take it that seriously. And I want to prove that I could do it! I took lots of time clarifying how dataflow work and took a note in order to rememeber all user behaviors and dataflow. The fifth month I was there, my team successfully released first new wireless gaming keyboard with detachable numpad. It was good to achieve my goal with my team, and I got positive feedback from my manager:) I think my positive attitude and ownership drive me to succeed.

### Decision?

> During my academic year, I collaborated with the 4-people team as a team leader and we need to decide what we should do! I recommanded us to create a website to visualize the real-time product data from e-commerce website to save time on online shopping. However, it was a big challenge for us because the project scale was to large which includes visualization with d2.js, using Apollo and GraphQL and data mining using Python. No one agree with my idea first because they thought we did not have enough time. However, I told them that we will be proud of it and learned lots of thing from this project not only technical skills but also communication skills. Furthermore, I conducted market research and showed the report to them that all the technical skills we used are popular in job market. In this case, we could show this project in the interview. As a result, they all agreed my perspective and we successfully submit it by the deadline and got positive feedback from professor!

### Why frontend?

There are several reasons why I choose Front-End Developer.

- First of all, I am passionate about providing a solution to solve the real world problem! For example, I took the initiative to participate global hachathon and worked with 3 people to create a platform to deal with the shortage of daily supplies during Coronavirus Pandemic.
- Secondly, I am eager to learn new technology and there are always lots of chances to learn new tech as a front-end developer because technology is constantly changing and never stops.
- Last but not least, a sense of accomplishment. As a front-end developer, our job is not only just creating an interface, but we could also visualize the data to help business maximize their productivity. In this case, I feel a sense of achievement to improve real-world issue.
- Thats why I choose Front-End Developer because I am passionate about providing a solution to solve the real world problem/ I am eager to learn new technology/ a sense of accomplishment

### Why leave?

1.  I’ve learned a lot in my current role, but I’m looking for the next step where I can continue to grow and use the skills I’ve learned to contribute to a company I love
2.  I am passionate about facing new challenge and improve real-world issue! And this opportunity seems to be the perfect fit
    <!-- 3.  I will return to Amercia for green card and apply for citizenship -->

### Career Goal?

1. Short Term

   - In the short term, since I am a junior develop, I would like to improve my technical skills first such as how to optimzie the performance of React App and also improve my soft skill such as communication skill because it will has lots of opportunity to collaberate with UX designer, software engineer and project manager.

2. Long Term

   - In the long term, I would like to manage a team as a team leader. I will take course about leadership on Udemy and proactively take on leadership positions in team projects. Secondly, I would like to become a full-stack developer in the future not only app development but also backend development!

### Weakness and strength

- Weakness: Lack experience => I do not have lots of experience in solving real-world issue and sometimes I need to take lots of time identifying the cause of the issue. After joining the ASUS, my manager taught me that I need to narrow the issue down by understanding how dataflow work first. In this case, I could save lots of time on identifying the cause of the issue. Although I do not have lots of experience in solving issue, I am still a highly-proactive person who is willing to learn and earn experience.

- strength: Communication skill => I am very collaberative and willing to work with people to achieve the goal. During the time at ASUS as a frontend developer, to minimize the communication gap between UI design and backend developer, I took the initiative to learn UI concept such as HOW TO USE COLOR IN DESIGN and also learn backend technique to understand more about RESTFUL API in order to make sure we speak the same language and could clearly express ideas to improve the efficiency of communication.
