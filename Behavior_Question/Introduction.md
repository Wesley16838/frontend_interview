# Introduce yourself

&emsp;My name is Wei-Hsuan Wong, currently a Junior Frontend Developer at ASUS with one more year of experience on React and Redux. In my short time there, I have already contributed to optimized a million-users application performance by redeveloping componentâ€™s architecture with reduced load time. I also have experience on Data Visualization when I was frontend intern at Advantech which I collaberated with Backend and UI design team to create user-friendly data a'nalysis and visualization tool to improve user experience. Besides, I worked with UI designer to build a RWD Website for a furniture company when I was frontend intern at Creatop.
&emsp;During my academic years, I took the initiative to participate in the global Hackathon which encourages participants to provide solutions to improve issues related to coronavirus pandemic such as the shortage of supply. Thus, I cooperated with 3-people team to build a daily supplise exchange website and I was incharge of implement posting, showing and accepting user request on Google Map using React Hooks and Context API. Furthermore, I collaborated with my classmates to build a website for visualizing price comparison. I was responsible for visualizing real-time products data using React.js and d3.js and mining data from Amazon and eBay using Python.
&emsp;Since I have lots of experience in collaborating with various teams, I am capable of working well with people from different disciplines. Most important of all, I am a highly-proactive person and willing to learn unfamiliar technologies. I believe that my experience and characteristic will make me a competitive candidate.
