# Introduce yourself

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Wei-Hsuan Wong! I am currently a Junior Frontend Developer at ASUS with over one year of professional experience in React, Redux and over three years of experience in Frontend development. During my time at ASUS, my team is in charge of developing a million-user application and I am responsible for developing the features of the main product - gaming keyboards such as customizing lighting effect and power manipulating/ monitoring. Moreover, I not only fixed issues related to the compatibility of multiple language keyboard but also re-develop each component using React Hooks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have experience in Data Visualization when I interned at Advantech as a Front-End Developer in an Agile team. During my time at Advantech, I collaborated with the Backend team from Beijing to create user-friendly Data visualization dashboards for real-time monitoring, data analysis to save more equipment energy in order to help business maximize their productivity. Besides, my team presented the dashboard to potential customer in the Global exhibition and also won the summer intern award at the end of the internship.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my academic years, I collaborated with my classmates to build a price comparison visualization website to provide a solution for saving time on online shopping. I was responsible for visualizing real-time products data using React.js and d3.js and mining data from Amazon, Bestbuy and eBay using Python.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all, I am a highly proactive person and willing to solve real-world issues. I took the initiative to participate in Global Hackathon which encourages participants to provide solutions to improve issues related to Covid-19. Therefore, I worked with a 3-people team to build a daily supplies exchange website to deal with the shortage of daily supplies and cluster infection using React Hooks and Context API.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have lots of experience in collaborating with various teams, I am capable of working well with people from different disciplines. In addition, I am highly knowledgeable in Frontend development with proven experience above. I believe that my experience and characteristics will make a competitive candidate.
