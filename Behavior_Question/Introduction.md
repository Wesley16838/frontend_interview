# Introduce yourself

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Wei-Hsuan Wong and nice to meet you! I am currently a Junior Frontend Developer at ASUS with over one year of experience on React, Redux and over two years of experience on Frontend development. During my time at ASUS, I not only optimized a million-user application performance by redeveloping the component’s architecture but also solving existing issues such as the compatibility of multiple language Keyboards. I also have experience on Data Visualization when I was a frontend intern at Advantech, where I collaberated with Backend team from Beijing to create user-friendly data a'nalysis and visualization tools to improve user experience.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my academic years, I collaborated with my classmates to build a website to visualize price comparison. I was responsible for visualizing real-time products data using React.js and d3.js and mining data from Amazon and eBay using Python.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all, I am a highly-proactive person and willing to learn unfamiliar technologies. I took the initiative to participate in Global Hackathon which encourages participants to provide solutions to improve issues related to Covid-19. Therefore, I worked with a 3-people team to build a daily supplies exchange website using React Hooks and Context API to deal with the shortage of supplies. Furthermore, I work with a UI designer to create a mobile platform using React Native and AWS Cloud Services to assist overseas students build networks with Taiwanese referrals who work in America easily.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have lots of experience in collaborating with various teams, I am capable of working well with people from different disciplines. In addition, I am highly knowledgeable in Frontend development with proven experience above. I believe that my experience and characteristics will make me a competitive candidate.
