# Introduce yourself

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Wei-Hsuan Wong! I'm the UI design engineer of the Global Design Team at VISA with one half year of professional experience in React ecosystem and over three years of experience in Frontend development. During my time at VISA, I am responsible for developing projects handed over by the UI Design team and am actively involved in meetings with stakeholders to build a POC to determine whether an idea can be turned into a reality in the early stages of product design process. I am currently working on maintaining an existing Android app built in Kotlin and developing an iOS app built with Flutter simultaneously. I have already fixed issues caused by migrating the old app to Flutter 2 and upgrading all upgradable libraries. Besides, I also improved code quality through refactoring legacy code by splitting requirements into different components.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before joining VISA, I worked at ASUS as a front-end developer of Gaming Accessories which is in charge of developing a million-user application that allows users to connect, configure and cotrol gaming product easier. I was responsible for developing the features of the main product - gaming keyboards such as customizing lighting effect and power manipulating/ monitoring using react and redux. One of main issue I fixed is the compatibility of multiple language keyboard and I also modifeid the legacy codebase to migrated class components to react hooks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, I have experience in Data Visualization when I interned at Advantech as a Front-End Developer in an Agile team. During my time at Advantech, I collaborated with the Backend team in Beijing to create user-friendly Water treatment management dashboards using AngularJS for improve real-time monitoring, data analysis to save more equipment energy in order to help business maximize their productivity. My team also presented the dashboard to potential customer in the global exhibition and also won the summer intern award at the end of the internship.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all, I am a highly proactive person and willing to solve real-world issues. I took the initiative to participate in Hackathon which encourages participants to provide solutions to assist visitors to collect information more efficient such as cycling routes and real-time tracker. Therefore, I teamed up with three different designers to build three responsive websites including Taiwan Travel Guide, Bicycle Guide, and bus tracker using Next.js/ TypeScript and Context API.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have lots of experience in collaborating with various teams and am willing to learn different knowledge to minimize the gap between developer, designer and project manager, I am capable of working well with people from different disciplines. In addition, I am highly knowledgeable in Frontend development with proven experience above. I believe that my experience and characteristics will make me a standout candidate.

# Why Apple and why this job?

> I have used Apple products for years, and whenever they updated their User Interface design for websites and products, their innovation and development never fail to amaze me. Although their UI Design is insanely creative in style, Apple still always put the user first which mean Products is always easy to use no matter how innovative it looks. I am the person who like to think outside the box and provide meaningful and relevant experiences to client, that's why I like Apple because, at Apple, imagination has no limits, and our ideas maybe have a way of becoming products and providing a better user experience to the client.
