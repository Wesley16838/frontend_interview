# Short Term

   - In the short term, since I am a junior develop, I would like to keep learning to improve my front-end skills first such as how to optimzie the performance of the product and also improve my soft skill such as communication skill because it will has lots of opportunity to collaberate with people from different team. 
   For example, I am the only developer who is responsible for the UI development of this project. Hence, I need to demo the app to stakeholders in every demo call and the project owner may provides some ideas and ask me this idea could be implemented or not. I need to clearly express my idea and translate my idea to the language they understand. That's why I would like to improve my communication skill.

# Long Term

   - In the long term, I would like to manage a team as a team leader. I will take course about leadership on Udemy and proactively take on leadership positions in team projects. Secondly, I would like to become a full-stack developer in the future not only app development but also backend development!
