### Why AWS QuickSight and position?

There are several reasons why?

- I highly resonate with the value of the product
  Amazon QuickSignt provides visualization tool to help business improve their productivity It not only uses machine learning to predict outcomes such as forecasting without prior data, but also embed analytics into application, empowering users to get deeper insights into the application’s data.
- I am passionate about analyzing and visualizing data based on users' requirements to help business easily analyze data and make decisions based on the data! For example, I have experience in Data Visualization when I interned at Advantech. I was responsible for creating world-class water treatment management dashboard for the sewage treatment plant. During the time at Advantech, my team had a chance to present the dashboard to customer in International exhibition and interacted with them directly. I felt a sense of achievement not only because present our project to the customer but we also actually provided a solution to business for improving decision making.
  This is why I choose Amazon QuickSignt and this position because I have a passion for improving the user experience for customers by visualizing data based on their requirements and Amazon also always (focuses on how to improve customer experience!)

### Why Front-End Developer?

- There are several reasons why I choose Front-End Developer.
- First of all, I am a problem-solver and be willing to provide solution to improve any issues(solve the real world problem)! For example, I participated global hachathon and worked with 3 people to create a platform to deal with the shortage of daily supplies during Coronavirus Pandemic.
- Secondly, I am eager to learn new technology and there are always lots of chances to learn new tech as a front-end developer. For example, I worked with a team to visualize real-time data using React.js and D3.js which are unfamiliar tech stack for me and which means it was a good opportunity for me to learn.
- Last but not least, a sense of accomplishment. As a front-end developer, our job is not only just creating an innovative and interactive interface, but we visualizing the data correctly to help business maximize their productivity. For example, during the time at Advantech, my team was responsible for developing a water treatment management dashboard to make the equipment for energy-saving and economical.
  Thats why I choose Front-End Developer because I am willing to provide solution to solve problems and learning unfamiliar technologies and a sense of accomplishment!
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### What are the characteristics of a good leader?

- First of all, communication. A good communation skills are one of the leadership attributes that are absolutely crucial because a positive communication could inspire the team by their vision with enthusiasm and passion. After all, Employee engagement could drive employee productivity and business success. Ex. during my academic year, I collaborated with the 4-people team to build a website as a team leader. I am willing to encourage and inspire people base on the outcome even though they did not fulfill the requirement. One of my teammates was responsible for building a chart, but he did not properly apply the design to the end product. Thus, I encouraged him to go above and beyond the expection to make a better outcome. As a result, our team achieved high scores in the class and got positive feedback from the professor which was the best one he had ever seen.
- Secondly, Think with different perspective. As a leader, I am not the learner anymore, instead, I am both learner and mentor. Therefore, as a mentor, learners are just like customers, I need to think like a customer and put myself into their shoes. Therefore, sometimes I need to analyze the root cause of mentor failure and then implement changes that prevent repeat occurrences to improve customer experience, rather than just mentoring without any changes.
- In conclusion, Leaders have a direct impact on employee satisfaction, motivation and productivity. A good leadership communication could inspire and encourage the team in order to drive employee productivity and business success. And thinking with a different perspective could understand more what the team actually need and improve teamwork in the workplace.

### How to Choose the Right Technology Stack for learning?

- Personal Requirements: I am used to knowing what my requirement and purpose are first before choosing the technologies. For example, during my academic year, I was usually responsible for front-end development includes web and mobile, so I needed to learn more about front end development first to improve my skills.
- Conduct Market research: In this case, whenever I applied for position of front-end developer, I took time on reviewing job requirement to analyze what markets requirement needs is? For example, there are three popular frameworks which are Angular, React and Vue and most of the requirements contain those three frameworks, and the React has already been the top framework in the marget for a long time.
- Practicality: I have experience in mobile development using natvie language which are JAVA and Swift! Thus, I knew it was quite hard to learn three of them at the same time. Thus, after learning ReactJS, I choose to learn React Native which is a cross platform technology because both React and React Native is based on JavaScript and their syntax and workflow are similar.
  In conlcusion, I choose the technology stack based on the personal requirement, Conduct Market research, and Practicality.

### How to Choose the Right Technology Stack for Your Project?

In my last role, when I collaberated with 3-people team in Global Hackathon and needed to create a website in three 3 days, I knew that choosing the right technology stack plays an important role because we didn't have lots of time on it. Therefore, there are 4 things to consider when I choose a tech stack!

- First of all, project requirements and feature: We built a features list and prioritize features base on the purpose of the website, daily supply exchanging. After making sure the Scope of Project, Node.js and React.js can be perfect for small project.
- Secondly, experience, resource and time: Although I have experience in AngularJS and Vue.js, I am more familiar with React.js, Redux and it's ecosystem. Besides, we needed to complete it in three days becasue it was a Hackathon. Moreover, there are lots of resouce I could search on Google and Using React could save time in completing it.
- Last, follow trends: I am willing to learn unfamiliar technologies but I will research its ecosystem and make sure whether its popular or not in the job market in advance. Since I picked React.js and knew Hooks and Context API was popular at that time, so my final choices are Hooks/ Context API
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### What did I do if there are not lots of document and resource to search?

If I have already chose there tech stack, then I will do three things if I do not have lots of time!

- First of all, read: Document and technical article are always the best partner for me. I would take time on reading document first and choose the right article based on the feature I am going to develop.
- Secondly, Search: After beginning to develop, Stack Overflow could be a perfect partner for me. Although there are not lots of resource to search, I could still find a little useful information and then complete the jigsaw puzzle eventually!
- Last, ask: If I still could not solve some specific problems, do not be shy to ask! Like what I mention above, I will post a question on Stack Overflow to ask for help. Not only i could improve my soft skills by communicating with other people, but I could also enhence my technical skills by getting advices from expert.

### What is the most important characteristic for software engineer?

- Collaboration skills: As a Software Engineer, I not only just sit in front of the desk but also need to communicate with co-work from different disciplines includes firmware, Backend, and UI. For example, I am responsible for developing gaming Keyboard Interface and front-end features. I need to discussed and defined the request body stucture with the backend developer and talk more about behavior of the elements with UI designer to clarity all the controversial parts. To minimize the gap between of them and make sure we speak same language, I always take time on analyzing the structure of server API and learning UI/UX concept to improve efficiency of communication. After all,A good collaboration could maximize the benefit for company
- Curiosity and eagerness: As a Software Engineer, if I stop learning, I stop growing. As technology advanced, there are new tools to choose from and we should keep updating knowledge in our brain. The skills we used may not suitable for the new app. For example, I learned JavaScript before and use plain JavaScript to develop the whole UI page. However, I would like to optimize the performance of the app and improve the process of development, after I read latest technical article, I found that using React could not only break UI into reusable components, but the Virtual DOM which is a programming concept could also avoid unnecessary reflowing and repainting! Curiosity and eagerness play important role to make me a better software engineer!

## Which thing is the most important to consider when I design/develop Interface?

- Mobile first and friendly: According to the statistic , more and more people access the internet only from their smartphone in six years! Also, small-screen friendly make digital product more readable on small screen and more helpful for people who is hard of seeing. For example, when I was interned at Creatop, I collaberated with an UI designer to re-designed and re-developed a webpage for furniture company. Since original one is hard to read on small screen, we decided to make it more responsive and simple. After implementing mobile-first design, we successfully received positive feedback from customers and furniture company!

### Tell me about your strength and weakness and why?

- Somethimes soft skill is more important thant technical skill, I am very collaberateive and willing to work with people from other dicsplines. During the time at ASUS, I am responsible for develop Interface gaming keyboard, so I need to communicate with UI Designer for understanding components behavior and discuss http request body structure with Backend developer. Before communicating, I am used to researching related info to improve the efficiency of communication and that was what learned during the time at ASUS.
- Lacking experience in solving issue, as a junior developer, I do not have lots of experience in Front-End development if compare with senior. However, I am a highly-proactive person who is willing to learn! During the time at ASUS, the most important thing I learn is how to solve the issue with the correct method. I need to understand data flow and architecture first, so I could know where the issue from easier. In the past, I usually took lots of time on just how to fix functions rather than understood the data flow first.

### Challenge Project

- HeartTrade

  - I took the initiative to participate online Global Hackathon which encourage people to provide solutions to improve issue related to the COVID-19. Thus, after communicating with my team, we decided to create a daily supplies exchange platform to deal with the shortage of supplies DURING coronavirus pandemic. I was responsible for whole front-end side includes Posting, accepting and showing request on Google Map using React Hooks and Context API. Although we didn't win the award, we still learned lot such as how to work with people who are in different time zone.
  - The most difficult part was how to collaberate with a remote team to create a platfotm in three days! Since everyone worked from home, it was not effective to talk with teammate who were at different time zone. Communication gap was a biggest issue for us and it was quite hard to track what each teammate hah already done so far! Thus, we decided to use Trello to manage the team so each team member could create a card for the task and all people could follow each other more efficient. And after considering the project scope and the purpose, the first thing we did was listing all features and prioritize features base on the purpose of the website so that we could focused on necessary features and make sure we could uploaded it by deadline. As a result, we successfully upload and deploy the project to Heroku by the deadline because we minimized the communication gap by using collaberation tool and prioritize feature base on requirement!
  - follow up: ASUS work from home! - During the tiem at ASUS, I worked from home from Feb to March and since I have experience in collaberating with a remote team. I know how to minimize the communication gap with teammate using Trello and Teams and lists high priority tasks first that must be finish during the time work at home. As a result, during the time work at home, I successfully introduced a new feature Power Page which could monitor the status of power and change power setting for the new wireless gaming keyboard.

### Proud Project

- Advantech
  - When I interned at Advantech, my team was in charge of developing water treatment management dashboard. Therefore, interns collaborated with the Front-End Team to optimize the dashboard to improve data analysis for better user experience and maximize the benefit for sewage treatment plants! I was responsible for creating new panels for specific wastewater equipments using AngularJS and Svg. As an agile team, we had sprint planning meeting once two weeks to create sprint task backlog and also had Review and 'Retrospect meeting with Backend team from Beijing once two weeks to review what we had already accomplished and discuss how to improve development process. During the time at Advantech, Intern had opportunity to present the dashboard to potential customer in the international exhibition and collected the feedback from them. At the end of the internship, my team won the intern award for excellence in teamwork.
  - I felt a sense of achievement during the intern at Advantech because we had chance to show we have already done to real customer in the international exhibition and get the positive feedback from customer! I am really proud of this project becasue it not only improve my technical skill but also soft skill!
  - The difficult part is communicate with customer. Since it is my first to directly communicate with customer face to face. It was a good opportunity to improve my soft skill. It's almost impossible to
    satisfy all customer needs. Therefore, I try to listen their feedback and undersand what customer's needs to build a good relationship with them. After all, I always put the customer first!
    One of feedback was customer would like to see all panels at the same time when page finish loading. However, we show panels asynchronously rather than synchronously because different types of equipments need different time to load data. Thus, to gain customer trust, I explained what the side effect is if we show all panel together at the same time and also provide feasible solution which is showing panel with higher priority first!

### Tell me about a time when you had a group conflict and how did you overcome this conflict?

- ASUS
  - During the time at ASUS, I was responsible for gaming keyboard which is the main device in the app, so I have lots of chances to communicate with people from different departments. As a front end developer in ASUS, I am responsible for dealing with bugs first and clarify what causes bugs and where they come from once software has bugs. One of backend developers who was responsible for gaming keyboard like to avoid taking responsibility so he usually thought I could deal with the issue by front-end side, but sometimes it did not follow the data flow and make application slower. For example, when the page is loading for the first time, the gaming keyboard would be set up based on the setting. He said SDK couldn't store the parameter of gaming mode and asked me to send extra request to set gaming mode. This method did not follow the data flow and it would slow the performance down because of extra http requests. Therefore, I began to take more time on making myself acquainted with the structure of application, and collected more useful information to support my solution in order to express my idea clearly and convince him to follow the dataflow. Therefore, I explained why I disagree with this solution due to data flow and performance. As a result, he successfully fixed the issue on the backend side rather than send an extra request to set gaming mode again. After that, I started to understand that communication skill plays an important role to minimize our communication gap between us.
  - What I learned from this experience was how to communicate and collaberate with the co-work who are not willing to take responsibility. I need to acquaint application structure more and clarify what causes the issue in order to narrow the issue down and then provide some feasible solutions with advantages and disadvantages before communication so I could convince them to do their tasks.

### The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?

- During the time at Advantech, my team have chance to present the visualization dashboard to customer in the international exhibition. The day before exhibition, one of panels did not work suddenly and I immediately admitted my mistake and did my best to clarify the issue as soon as possible! I checked CSS and found that display grid did not support IE browser. Since we did not have time to modify the code, so the solution we used was openning the panel on the Chrome and made a video for the panel and pasted it on the dashboard as an image! As a result, we successfully presented the dashboard to the customer
- What I learn is admitting the mistake first when I make a mistake and try to provide some feasible solution to minimize the cost of mistake rather than make excuses for someone, so we could earn the trust from customer again.
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Give me an example of something you tried to accomplish but failed

- During the time at Advantech, I was responsibe for developing mobile app on both front-end and back-end. There was one time that manager asked us to present demo to customer in two days and it was not in our original plan. Thus, I immediately hold a meeting with teammate and customer to tell cusonter why we could finish all features by the deadline but we could prioritize the features and make sure which features are more important for customer. As a result, we successfully presented demo to customer in two days but only high priority features. What I learn is keeping customer trust is important than anything even I fail on something. If I couldn’t finish task before deadline, I will admit my fault first and do my best to minimize the cost of this mistake by communicating with customers for possible solution to earn trust back from customer.
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### What is the impact of a front-end engineer

- Frontend Developer plays a crucial role in the team for two reasons.
- First of all, front-end developer understand enough about design concepts, so a frontend developer could work with UI/UX team more efficiently to make the interface work properly and smoothly.
- Secondly, front-end developer know project's architecture and how data flow works between frontend and backend, so Frontend developer could also work with backend-developer more efficiently to save time on interacting between View and Database.
  In conclusion, frontend developer is a bridge between UI designer and Backend Developer. A good Front-end with a good Design make website easy to use and a good front-end with a good back-end could improve website performance!
  - Follow-up : Work with UI Designer
    **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Tell me about a time when you innovated on something and it went wrong

- Fail: During the time at ASUS, I am responsible for developing interface for gaming keyboard. Currently, since we only design US keyboard layout which mean we only allow users to assign U.S key function to each key, I needed to solve the issue related to the compatibility of multiple languages keyboard. Thus, I came up with an idea that other engineer never try it before. I created multiple JSON files to store different language data and it was an feasible solution but my manager disagree with my idea becasue the whole file size would too big. Therefore, after discussing with manager about other possible solutions, we decided to use webpack to filter the folders of actions and components that keyboard does not use to make installation file more lightweight. I am still working on developing this feature and have already added more than 5 languages so far. Although my original idea went wrong but I immediately provide other solutions to improve the issue!(We did not implement this feature before because it was not in the original plan but there was a customer from spain said the key function he assigned did not match spanish layout!)

- Succeed: During my academic year, I worked with my classmated to build a website for final project. Professor asked us couldn't build a bookstore or social media which are common topic. Since I usually took lots of time on comparing the product's price between different websites, I came up with an idea that building a price comparison visualization website to save time on finding the best price on an item becasue our brain process images much faster than text! After conducting a market survey, we decided to mine real-time data from Amazon, Bestbuy and Ebay which are top e-commerce websites in the America. As a result, we successsfult deploy it to the cloud and got positive feedback from professor!
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Tell me about a time when a team member didnt meet your expectations on a project

- During my academic year, I collaberated with my classmates to build a price comparison visualization website. Since I had more experience on web development, I was responsible for assigning tasks to my teammate. However, one of my teammates didn't meet the requirement of RWD which was one of bonus Criteria for final project. Therefore, I took the iniative to mentor teammate how to implement responsive web design using SCSS becasue I would like to make project more responsive and could be present on small size screen. As a result, my team got A+ and positive feedback which was perfect UI Design from professor! Ownership and Insist on the Highest Standards play important roles in making a good outcome because both of them could make project better!

### Tell me a time when you disagree your manager

- When I interned at Brilltek, I was responsible for developing the interface for mobile app as a team leader. Thus, we had meeting once a week with backend developer and project manager. There was one time that the manager thought we should add anime to the interface in the step one! However, I always like to provide the best quality to the customer, so I communicate with manager to talk about whether we could put the anime to the second stage because we did not have enough time on optimize the anime in the stage one and promise customer that we could present a better anime in Stage two. In the end, I learned a few thing from this experience which was even I disagree with mananger, I still provide possible solution to manager in order to minimize the cost of the disagreeing!
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Tell me about a time when you have to say no

- During the time at Brilltek as a full stack developer, I led a front-end team to developer mobile app using Flutter. We had a meeting once a week with manager and client. There was one time that customer suddenly asked us add anime to the mobile app to make it more smooth. After considering the time, I declined the request and explain why we could not finish the feature in the first stage for two reasons. The first one was we shall focus on developing high priority features first to make sure the app could work at least and then move on to optimize performance. Secondly, the performance might not as good as you expected because we did not have enough time to optimize it and we would like to give users the best user experience. As a result, we told the customer that our team will do the best to optimize anime and other performance in the Stage two and he thought proposal was acceptable. Although I decline the request from customer, I still did my best to earn trust back and dont make them disappoint.

### Think back on a project that you worked on, what steps did you take to make sure that it targets the needs of your customers?

- During the time at Advantech as a front-end internship in an Agile team, we were responsible for optimizing the water treatment management dashboard to improve customer experience on monitoring and analytic. To assure we had a sprint review meeting with customers to present the demo to customer and other stakeholders to make sure we meets the requirements. After collecting feedbacks from customers, we would hold sprint retrospective meeting to discuss about how to improve the process of development based on the feedback from customers. As a result, since we had a meeting twice a week with customer to make sure we met their requirement, we successfully present the dashboard to customer in the international exhibition and got positive feedback from customer.

### Tell me about your proudest professional achievement

- Advantech
- When I interned at Advantech, my team was in charge of developing water treatment management dashboard. Therefore, interns collaborated with the Front-End Team to optimize the dashboard to improve data analysis for better user experience and maximize the benefit for sewage treatment plants! I was responsible for creating new panels for specific wastewater equipments using AngularJS and Svg.

### Tell me about an example when you were able to deliver an important project under a tight deadline

- In my current position, I am responsible for developing the interface of gaming keyboard. At the end of the 2020, I was working on developing the new architecture for wireless gaming keyboard and the old version was no longer maintained. However, the Department Chief requested us to release new verson at the end of the December because there were too many existing issues in the old version! Therefore, I immediately held a meeting with project manager and backend developer to reschedule our plan. After communicating with project manager, I decided to focus on developing high priority features, the Power page which allows user to minitor the status of power and change power setting for keyboard and at least make sure to aviod app crush! I always like to deliver a high quality user experience to customer, so I took the initiative to work overtime to fix the bugs and made the page more responsive! As a result, my team successully presented wireless gaming keyboard to custoemr in the Press Conference by the deadline.
- What I learn is ownership and customer obsession play important roles in a good outcome! Since ASUS always provides the best quality product to the customer to earn customer's trust. I did not want to make customer disappoint, so I keep in a positive attitude and communicate with the team for a feasible solution, and then list higher priority features
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Times You Missed A Deadline

- When I was an intern at Brilltek, I collaborated with backend team to create serverless RESTful API using Firebase to communicate with mobile app. My manager suddenly sent me an email said that he needed to show a demo to customer in two days. Thus, we immediately discussed with customer which features has higher priority so I could finish main features before deadline. Finally, we successfully present demo to customer not only focus on higher priority task but having a good communication with co-worker and customer.
- In this case, not only discussing with the customer which main features would you like to see in this demo. Also, I used my private time to keep working on the task. After all, finishing the task with high quality as soon as possible is what we want. Furthermore, I am the person who like to give customer a better and smoother user experience of app. If we really cannot finish task before deadline. We will communicate with customer and tell them why and earn their trust back and also do our best to finish tasks asap.
- What I learn is keeping customer trust is important than anything. If I couldn’t finish task before deadline, I will admit fault first and do my best to minimize the cost of this mistake by communicating with customers for possible solution to earn trust back from customer.
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Tell me a time when you received a tough or critical piece of feedback and how you deal with it

- During the time at Advantech, interns have opportunity to present dahsboard to customer in international exhibition. We collected lots of feedback from customer and one of feedback was customer would like to see all panels at the same time when page finish loading. To gain customer trust, I agreed with him first and explain why we don't show all panel together. Since Javascript is single thread language, we show panels asynchronously rather than synchronously because if we show the panels synchronously, customers would take lots of time on waiting for loading data from all equipments. I also provide feasible solution which is showing panel with higher priority first based on the times of click in the sprint review meeting and manager said the team might implement this proposal in the future! As a result, I earned the trust from customer becasue I didn't deny the feedback from him but agreed with him and provide possible solution based on users requirement!
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### Tell me about a time when you mentor other engineers

- During the time at ASUS, there was a new graduate student just joined my team recently and I was assigned to teach him to understand the architecture of the application and the data flow. I remembered that when I joined the team last year, there were only two people in the team includes me and there was no documentation about application. Therefore, I took lots of time on reading the code, understanding the app architecture and data flow. To improve the efficiency of development and save time on learning, I created documentation about the app and wrote the content related to the process of development down. As a result, I saved lot of time on mentoring the new engineer on understanding the architecture of applicatoin and try to mentored him from his perspective so that he could absord information more efficient!
  **[⬆ Back to Top](#question)**

### think differently

- During the time at Advantech, I was responsible for collaberating with UI designer to develop the panel interface. At first, I took lots of time on learning how to operate the panel becasue the interface was to complicated and made me confused sometime. Thus, I told to the designer what I thought and she said we should think like a customer not like a developer. In other words, we should understand who the target audience is and what their needs are. To develop a panel, I should think ok I am a Factory manager and how would I feel while operating the panel and how would I think when I monitor data by a panel! After all, if we care for people, people would care for our product! As a result, I try to implement design thinking to think big! understand more about the user ! and put myself in my customer's shoes! As a result, we successfully deliver high quality of dashboard to customer in the international exhibition and most of customers said it was easy to use and understand! (understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.)

### make decision without enough data

- During my academic year, I took the iniative to participate global hackathon which encourate people to prove solution to improve issue related to covid-19. Decision about topic is always the most diffcult part in the hackathon because we do not have enough data about customer! Thus, to save time on making decision what topic we should choose, we conducted a market survey to understand more about what customers actually need by conducting a user interview. As a result, rather than choose Data Visualization, we choose to create daily supplies exchanging platform to deal with the shortage of supplies because we found that lots of people did not have enough daily supplies such as face mask during coronavirus pandemic. Although we did not win the award, I still learned a lesson about how to make decisions without enough data. We did not have enough data initially, but we still find the data by conducting a user interview! After all, taking action is better than doing nothing!
