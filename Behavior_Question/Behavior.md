1. #### How to Choose the Right Technology Stack for Your Project?
   In my last role, when I collaberated with 3-people team in Global Hackathon and needed to create a website in three 3 days, I knew that choosing the right technology stack plays an important role because we didn't have lots of time on it. Therefore, there are 4 things to consider when I choose a tech stack!

- First of all, project requirements and feature: We built a features list and prioritize features base on the purpose of the website, daily supply exchanging. After making sure the Scope of Project, Node.js and React.js can be perfect for small project.
- Secondly, experience, resource and time: Although I have experience in AngularJS and Vue.js, I am more familiar with React.js, Redux and it's ecosystem. Besides, we needed to complete it in three days becasue it was a Hackathon. Moreover, there are lots of resouce I could search on Google and Using React could save time in completing it.
- Last, follow trends: I am willing to learn unfamiliar technologies but I will research its ecosystem and make sure whether its popular or not in the job market in advance. Since I picked React.js and knew Hooks and Context API was popular at that time, so my final choices are Hooks/ Context API

2. #### (Follow-Up) What did I do if there are not lots of document and resource to search?
   If I have already chose there tech stack, then I will do three things if I do not have lots of time!

- First of all, read: Document and technical article are always the best partner for me. I would take time on reading document first and choose the right article based on the feature I am going to develop.
- Secondly, Search: After beginning to develop, Stack Overflow could be a perfect partner for me. Although there are not lots of resource to search, I could still find a little useful information and then complete the jigsaw puzzle eventually!
- Last, ask: If I still could not solve some specific problems, do not be shy to ask! Like what I mention above, I will post a question on Stack Overflow to ask for help. Not only i could improve my soft skills by communicating with other people, but I could also enhence my technical skills by getting advices from expert.

3. #### What is the most important characteristic for software engineer?(At least two examples)

   - Collaboration skills: As a Software Engineer, I not only just sit in front of the desk but also need to communicate with co-work from different disciplines includes firmware, Backend, and UI. For example, I am responsible for developing gaming Keyboard Interface and front-end features. I need to discussed and defined the request body stucture with the backend developer and talk more about behavior of the elements with UI designer to clarity all the controversial parts. To minimize the gap between of them and make sure we speak same language, I always take time on analyzing the structure of server API and learning UI/UX concept to improve efficiency of communication. After all,A good collaboration could maximize the benefit for company
   - Curiosity and eagerness: As a Software Engineer, if I stop learning, I stop growing. As technology advanced, there are new tools to choose from and we should keep updating knowledge in our brain. The skills we used may not suitable for the new app. For example, I learned JavaScript before and use plain JavaScript to develop the whole UI page. However, I would like to optimize the performance of the app and improve the process of development, after I read latest technical article, I found that using React could not only break UI into reusable components, but the Virtual DOM which is a programming concept could also avoid unnecessary reflowing and repainting! Curiosity and eagerness play important role to make me a better software engineer!

4. #### Which thing is the most important to consider when I design/develop Interface?

   - Mobile first: According to the statistic , more and more people access the internet only from their smartphone in six years! Thus, small-screen friendly make digital product more readable on small screen and more helpful for people who is hard of seeing. For example, when I was interned at Creatop, I collaberated with an UI designer to re-designed and re-developed a webpage for furniture company. Since origin one is hard to read on small screen, we decided to make it more responsive and simple. After implementing mobile-first design, we successfully received positive feedback from customers and furniture company!

5. #### Tell me about your strength and weakness and why?

   - Somethimes soft skill is more important thant technical skill, I am very collaberateive and willing to work with people from other dicsplines. During the time at ASUS, I am responsible for develop Interface gaming keyboard, so I need to communicate with UI Designer for understanding components behavior and discuss http request body structure with Backend developer. Before communicating, I am used to researching related info to improve the efficiency of communication and that was what learned during the time at ASUS.
   - Lacking experience in solving issue, as a junior developer, I do not have lots of experience in Front-End development if compare with senior. However, I am a highly-proactive person who is willing to learn! During the time at ASUS, the most important thing I learn is how to solve the issue with the correct method. I need to understand data flow and architecture first, so I could know where the issue from easier. In the past, I usually took lots of time on just how to fix functions rather than understood the data flow first.
