## Why Amazon QuickSight and position?

    Amazon QuickSignt let customer could create an user-friendly interactive Business Intellegence Dahsboard to not only perform accuate forecasting for business metrics but also easily customize dashboard to match application's requirement!
    I am passionate about analyzing and visualizing data based on users' requirements to maximize the benefit for outcomes! For example, I have experience in Data Visualization when I interned at Advantech. I was responsible for creating world-class water treatment management dashboard for the sewage treatment plant. During the time at Advantech, my team had a chance to present the dashboard to customer in International exhibition and interacted with them directly. I felt a sense of achievement not only because present our project to the customer but we also actually provided a solution to enhance decision making.
    This is why I choose Amazon QuickSignt and this position because I have a passion for improving the user experience for customers by visualizing data based on their requirements and Amazon also always focuses on how to improve customer experience!

## Why Front-End Developer?

    There are several reasons why I choose Front-End Developer. First of all, I am eager to learn new technology and there are always lots of chances to learn new tech as a front-end developer. For example,I worked with a team to visualize real-time data using React.js and D3.js which are unfamiliar tech stack for me and which means it was a good opportunity for me to learn.
    Secondly, presenting the application makes me feel a sense of achievement and give me more energy for learning. For instantce, I present the dashboard to customer in Interntional exhibitoin when I was intern at Advantech and I was so pround of my team.
    Last but not least, I am a problem-solver and be willing to provide solution to improve any issues! For example, I participated global hachathon and worked with 3 people to create a platform to deal with the shortage of daily supplies during Coronavirus Pandemic.
    Thats why I choose Front-End Developer!

1. #### How to Choose the Right Technology Stack for Your Project?
   In my last role, when I collaberated with 3-people team in Global Hackathon and needed to create a website in three 3 days, I knew that choosing the right technology stack plays an important role because we didn't have lots of time on it. Therefore, there are 4 things to consider when I choose a tech stack!

- First of all, project requirements and feature: We built a features list and prioritize features base on the purpose of the website, daily supply exchanging. After making sure the Scope of Project, Node.js and React.js can be perfect for small project.
- Secondly, experience, resource and time: Although I have experience in AngularJS and Vue.js, I am more familiar with React.js, Redux and it's ecosystem. Besides, we needed to complete it in three days becasue it was a Hackathon. Moreover, there are lots of resouce I could search on Google and Using React could save time in completing it.
- Last, follow trends: I am willing to learn unfamiliar technologies but I will research its ecosystem and make sure whether its popular or not in the job market in advance. Since I picked React.js and knew Hooks and Context API was popular at that time, so my final choices are Hooks/ Context API

2. #### (Follow-Up) What did I do if there are not lots of document and resource to search?
   If I have already chose there tech stack, then I will do three things if I do not have lots of time!

- First of all, read: Document and technical article are always the best partner for me. I would take time on reading document first and choose the right article based on the feature I am going to develop.
- Secondly, Search: After beginning to develop, Stack Overflow could be a perfect partner for me. Although there are not lots of resource to search, I could still find a little useful information and then complete the jigsaw puzzle eventually!
- Last, ask: If I still could not solve some specific problems, do not be shy to ask! Like what I mention above, I will post a question on Stack Overflow to ask for help. Not only i could improve my soft skills by communicating with other people, but I could also enhence my technical skills by getting advices from expert.

3. #### What is the most important characteristic for software engineer?(At least two examples)

   - Collaboration skills: As a Software Engineer, I not only just sit in front of the desk but also need to communicate with co-work from different disciplines includes firmware, Backend, and UI. For example, I am responsible for developing gaming Keyboard Interface and front-end features. I need to discussed and defined the request body stucture with the backend developer and talk more about behavior of the elements with UI designer to clarity all the controversial parts. To minimize the gap between of them and make sure we speak same language, I always take time on analyzing the structure of server API and learning UI/UX concept to improve efficiency of communication. After all,A good collaboration could maximize the benefit for company
   - Curiosity and eagerness: As a Software Engineer, if I stop learning, I stop growing. As technology advanced, there are new tools to choose from and we should keep updating knowledge in our brain. The skills we used may not suitable for the new app. For example, I learned JavaScript before and use plain JavaScript to develop the whole UI page. However, I would like to optimize the performance of the app and improve the process of development, after I read latest technical article, I found that using React could not only break UI into reusable components, but the Virtual DOM which is a programming concept could also avoid unnecessary reflowing and repainting! Curiosity and eagerness play important role to make me a better software engineer!

4. #### Which thing is the most important to consider when I design/develop Interface?

   - Mobile first: According to the statistic , more and more people access the internet only from their smartphone in six years! Thus, small-screen friendly make digital product more readable on small screen and more helpful for people who is hard of seeing. For example, when I was interned at Creatop, I collaberated with an UI designer to re-designed and re-developed a webpage for furniture company. Since origin one is hard to read on small screen, we decided to make it more responsive and simple. After implementing mobile-first design, we successfully received positive feedback from customers and furniture company!

5. #### Tell me about your strength and weakness and why?

   - Somethimes soft skill is more important thant technical skill, I am very collaberateive and willing to work with people from other dicsplines. During the time at ASUS, I am responsible for develop Interface gaming keyboard, so I need to communicate with UI Designer for understanding components behavior and discuss http request body structure with Backend developer. Before communicating, I am used to researching related info to improve the efficiency of communication and that was what learned during the time at ASUS.
   - Lacking experience in solving issue, as a junior developer, I do not have lots of experience in Front-End development if compare with senior. However, I am a highly-proactive person who is willing to learn! During the time at ASUS, the most important thing I learn is how to solve the issue with the correct method. I need to understand data flow and architecture first, so I could know where the issue from easier. In the past, I usually took lots of time on just how to fix functions rather than understood the data flow first.

6. #### Challenge Project

   - PriCov

     - Online-Shopping is more popular then office shopping recently becasue of convenience. Normally customers use price comparison apps and websites to find the best price for the product they’re looking to buy. However, they still take lots of time on analysing. Therefore, since images are much easier to understand, we would like to provide a solution to visualize real-time products data to save users time on comparing. I was responsible for visualizing real-time products data using React and d3.js and mining data and from e-commerce website such as Amazon, eBay and Bestbuy using Python and Seleium. As a result, we not only successfully deployed it to the Cloud but also received positive feedback from professor.
     - The most difficult part is deploying mining server API to Heroku because there was not lots of document show how to open chrome browser on Heroku. The method we use to mine data is using Selenium to open the chrome browser and visit it by url user provided. Thus, the issue was how to open chrome on the cloud instead of the local environment. The first thing I did was keeping reading document and using Stack Overflow. Then I try to add arguments in the mining files so that web driver could open the chrome successfully. As a result, I successfully deploy it to Heroku and could be called by my website
     - What I learned is how to solve the issue. First of all, clarifying the issue to narrowed the issues down. Then, list all possible keywords and google it. Last but not least, keep positive and try it again and again!

   - HeartTrade

     - I took the initiative to participate online Global Hackathon which encourage people to provide solutions to improve issue related to the COVID-19. Thus, after communication with my team, we decide to create a daily supplies exchange platform to deal with the shortage of supplies DURING coronavirus pandemic. I was responsible for whole front-end side includes Posting, accepting and showing request on Google Map using React Hooks and Context API. Although we didn't win the award, we still learned lots of thing such as how to work with people who are in different time zone remotely.
     - The most difficult part is using unfamiliar tech stack becasue we needed to finish this project in several days, but it was still a good opportunity to improve unfamilir technologies. After considering the project scope and following trends, I decided to choose React Hooks and Context API because Hooks was getting popular in the job market. The first thing we did was list all features and prioritize features base on the purpose of the website so that we focused on necessary features. Eventually, we successfully upload and deploy to Heroku!

7. #### Pround Project

   - Advantech
     - When I interned at Advantech, my team was in charge of developing water treatment management dashboard. Therefore, interns collaborated with the Front-End Team to optimize the dashboard to improve data analysis for better user experience and maximize the benefit for sewage treatment plants! I was responsible for creating new panels for specific wastewater equipments using AngularJS and Svg. As an agile team, we had sprint planning meeting once two weeks to create sprint task backlog and also had Review and 'Retrospect meeting with Backend team from Beijing once two weeks to review what we had already accomplished and discuss how to improve development process. During the time at Advantech, Intern had opportunity to present the dashboard to potential customer in the international exhibition and collected the feedback from them. At the end of the internship, my team won the intern award for excellence in teamwork.
     - I felt a sense of achievement during the intern at Advantech because we had chance to show we have already done to real customer in the international exhibition and get the positive feedback from customer! I am really pround of this project becasue it not only improve my technical skill but also soft skill!
     - The difficult part is communicate with customer. Since it is my first to directly communicate with customer face to face. It was a good opportunity to improve my soft skill. It's almost impossible to
       satisfy all customer needs. Therefore, I try to listen their feedback and undersand what customer's needs to build a good relationship with them. After all, I always put the customer first!
       One of feedback was customer would like to see all panels at the same time when page finish loading. However, we show panels asynchronously rather than synchronously because different types of equipments need different time to load data. Thus, to gain customer trust, I explained what the side effect is if we show all panel together at the same time and also provide feasible solution which is showing panel with higher priority first!

8. #### Tell me about a time when you had a group conflict, and how did you overcome this conflict?

   - ASUS
     - During the time at ASUS, I was responsible for gaming keyboard which is the main device in the product, so I have lots of chances to communicate with people from different disciplines. Since it is my first full-time job, I have less experience in collaberate with people who are also full-time. At first, I was not familiar with the project structure. If error show up, I need to clarify where the issue come from and if this issue is from sdk which is a bridge to connect with firmware, I need to tell my co-worker whats going on and provide a solution to fix it. However, since I was not familiar wih architecture at first, he usually avoided dealing with the issuse because he thought I could figure it out. But it didn't follow the data flow and make app slower. For example, when user plug in the usb, we need to get device information and restore previous setting but it seens firmware cannot store gamming mode, so he suggest that I need to save the parameter in local file and set gamming mode when restore settings. It meant I had to sent one more request to SERVER API after restoring setting and it is not a good solution. Thus, I took time on understanding more about the data flow and structure and discussed with him again for a better solution. As a result, he successfully fixed issue rather than send extra request to set gamingmode again.
     - What I learn is how to prepare for discussing issues with co-work to clarify where issues come from. I need to understand more about the structure and clarify the issue to narrow the issues down and then provide some feasible solutions with advantages and disadvantages before decision.

9. #### The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?
