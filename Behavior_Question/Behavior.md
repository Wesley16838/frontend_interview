1. #### How to Choose the Right Technology Stack for Your Project?
   In my last role, when I collaberated with 3-people team in Global Hackathon and needed to create a website in three 3 days, I knew that choosing the right technology stack plays an important role because we didn't have lots of time on it. Therefore, there are 4 things to consider when I choose a tech stack!

- First of all, project requirements and feature: We built a features list and prioritize features base on the purpose of the website, daily supply exchanging. After making sure the Scope of Project, Node.js and React.js can be perfect for small project.
- Secondly, experience, resource and time: Although I have experience in AngularJS and Vue.js, I am more familiar with React.js, Redux and it's ecosystem. Besides, we needed to complete it in three days becasue it was a Hackathon. Moreover, there are lots of resouce I could search on Google and Using React is more efficient for us to complete it.
- Last, follow trends: I am willing to learn unfamiliar technologies but I will research its ecosystem and make sure whether its popular or not in the job market in advance. Since I picked React.js and knew Hooks and Context API was popular at that time, so my final choices are Hooks/ Context API
